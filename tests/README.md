# Tests
- Need to test and validate FedAdagrad (strategy parameters) for `initial_parameters`.
- Need to test that each corruption is correctly applied to the target data.
- Need to test that each experimental configuration is CORRECTLY writing logfile data to be used in terms of the target plots. Categorization is robust.
