# Crypton: A Secure Distributed Infrastructure for Encrypting Ensemble Neural Networks & Real-Time Updates in Distributed Multi-Agent Autonomous Systems

because the state of all smart contracts today is visible on the blockchain to anyone who wishes to look, it would be trivial for an attacker to steal the underlying neural net (once trained) and bypass the need to pay for its predictions.
- implement secure MPC, secure computation and scale up infra for ml training, data visibility, platformize models and scale operations in a decentralized fashion
