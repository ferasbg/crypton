# Crypton: A Secure, Privacy-Preserving Formal Verification Framework for Distributed Multi-Agent Autonomous Systems


## Introduction


## Background


## Problems
- lack of security, verification, and ensemble model validation for mission-critical distributed systems
- partial system failure & asynchrony in distributed infrastructure
- lack of robust fallback requests, and lack of ensemble model verification
- 3 problems are security (maintain privacy, perform computations with respect to encryption schemes), designing for scalability, robustness, and safety-first autonomy, automated ensemble neural network verification and system validation
- lack of implementation for lock-free infrastructure to handle balancing load from error handling for byzantine fault checking, model checkers, verification, satisfiability solvers, and robustness analysis
- fault-tolerant algorithms for verifying system robustness
- optimizing for computational efficiency given the gas costs associated with formal methods, running large-scale verification, and the like 
- authorizing computation in real-time sync for each agent in distributed multi-agent autonomous system with respect to preserving privacy & computational costs
