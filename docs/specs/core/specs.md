# crypton's specs

## core build significance
- full-stack secure ML infrastructure (via microservice architecture) for distributed multi-agent autonomous systems
- built-in neural network verification, byzantine fault checkers (for system faults), secure multi-party computation + federated learning for encrypted distributed n set of weights/biases/reward_functions/output from each agent that returns updated weights/architecture of set of each model in real-time.
- SMT/SAT satisfiability solvers
- byzantine fault checkers for neural network architecture
- test robustness of infrastructure with built-in adversaries in simulation, make sure to assess the ability for the set of k models to update in real-time while encrypted the shared learning from real-time behavior
- built-in event management for distributed nodes in network of autonomous agents
- zero-knowledge proofs to verify the authentication of parties/agents
- built-in real-time neural network architecture and infrastructure robustness analyzer 
- implemented equations to update variables for each set of n models for each node
- core algorithm to handle automatically checking robustness, running verification models and other external components to each set of models for each node (core implementation)
