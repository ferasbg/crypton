# Crypton: A Formal Verification Framework for Secure, Privacy-Preserving Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
The purpose of this work is to build a system that can formally verify the safety and robustness properties of a deep convolutional neural network for semantic image segmentation in a privacy-preserving, zero-trust approach with formal specifications for property inference and model checking.
