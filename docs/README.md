# Crypton: A Formal Verification Framework for Secure, Privacy-Preserving Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
The purpose of this work is to build a system that can formally verify the safety and robustness properties of a deep convolutional neural network in a privacy-preserving approach against formal specifications with abstract interpretation and bounded model checking, while maintaining precision, scalability, and computational efficiency.
