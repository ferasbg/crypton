# Crypton: Adversarial Robustness Verification for Privacy-Preserving, Decentralized Deep Convolutional Neural Networks 
The purpose of this work is to build a system that can formally verify the safety and robustness properties of a deep convolutional neural network in a privacy-preserving approach against formal specifications with abstract interpretation and bounded model checking, while maintaining precision, scalability, and computational efficiency.
