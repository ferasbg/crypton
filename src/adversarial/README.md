# `src.adversarial`
adversarial protocol for adversarial network training

## Requirements
- Store functions to compute robustness and performance under adversarial perturbations, and use for robustness certification and verification in `src.verification`. The functions will be called given the object which will generate a sub-class with respect to bounds and convex optimization.
