# Metrics
Creating all the plots for the initial paper.

## Plots
- Comm Rounds vs Client Adversarially-Regularized Accuracy (comparing reg. techniques + control/nominal)
- Comm Rounds vs. Server-Side Accuracy-Under-Attack
- Comm Rounds vs. Client-Side Adversarially-Regularized Loss (measuring for convergence behavior)
- Comm Rounds vs. Server-Side Loss-Under-Attack (measure for server-side strategy optimization against adaptive/non-adaptive strategies to aggregate client grads)
- Comm Rounds vs. Server-Side Accuracy-Under-Attack (Strategy + Adv. Reg. Technique)


## Parameters
- Range: 1-1000 Rounds
- Client Learning Rate: 0.1
- Server Learning Rate: 0.1
- Epsilon-Robust Perturbation Value: 0.05 (Server-Side)
- Perturbation Norm Type (Infinity)
