# Crypton Core
Execute experimental configurations to assess the most optimal configuration for a production-level federated system that is robust against adversarial attacks fixed by norm type and norm values. Though it's not fixed to norm type nor norm value. Attack vectors aren't limited to adversarial examples (adv. input generation).


## Notes
- create virality around a research project out of boredom; interoperability and clear goals regarding research can help make source project act as catalyst if it's useful and well-written code, and customizable and adaptable to people's needs
- diagrams to add involve the backend implementation using nsl and flwr
- diagrams involving nsl and dcnn and federated adagrad
- diagrams for system architecture
