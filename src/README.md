# Crypton Core
Execute experimental configurations to assess the most optimal configuration for a production-level federated system that is robust against adversarial attacks fixed by norm type and norm values.

Though it's not fixed to norm type nor norm value. Attack vectors aren't limited to adversarial examples (adv. input generation).
