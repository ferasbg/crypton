# crypton.Verification
Compute signal temporal logic specification for runtime verification of deep convolutional network structure, based on parameters and requirements with input bound propagation
## Tasks
- T0: Implement interval bound propagation for verifying adversarial robustness properties of DNN
- T1: compute a differentiable upper bound on the violation of the specification to verify
- T2: design and implement an STL monitor trace for specification for verifying robustness of semantic image segmentation model
- T3: Compute probabilistic guarantees of adversarial robustness and cryptographic scheme
