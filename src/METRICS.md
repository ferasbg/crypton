# METRICS
- graph the norm perturbation used against the average of the federated client models after each round
- table to mark specifications checked and evaluated
- table to compare features between other model checkers
- graphing federated client average accuracy against {FGSM, PGD} attacks
- for robustness / certification, you can graph the "robustness" as a threshold met given any adversarial attack
- epsilon vs l^2-bounded norm adversary
- epsilon vs l-infinity-bounded norm adversary
- compare accuracies of networks (note that adversarial examples optimized performance vs any other technique for natural training)
- BoundedNetworkSolver termination_time
- properties checked and the computation time for all trace properties
- PGD accuracy, FGSM accuracy
- Formally, given input x ∈ X and allowable input range B(x), the transformation T is sound if following condition is true: {fθ(˜x)|x˜ ∈ B(x), ∀x ∈ X} ⊆ T(X), e.g. the transformation of an input layer to an output layer, ensuring input-output robustness
- Certified Federated Accuracy vs Natural Federated Accuracy
